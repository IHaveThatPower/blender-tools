# blender-tools

This is (at present) a collection of tweaked addons written by other excellent 
Blender users. My own modifications to them are limite to ensuring 
compatibility with the most recent version of Blender (that I use, anyway). 
Eventually, I may add tools of my own devising to this collection, which I will
document here.
